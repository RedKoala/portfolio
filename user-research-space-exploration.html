								<h2 class="mt-60"> Project Origin</h2>
								<p>
									As a UX researcher and designer in the NASA HCI group, I build web-based systems to house data for human space exploration.  Each type of information has its own database with its own separate UI. 
								</p>
								<p>
									Engineers use our sites to record safety analyses of how every part on board the international space station could break and how to fix it, the requirements for the weather on launch day, and more. <span class="theme-1">All of this data is related, yet it is all siloed.</span>

                                 </p>
								<p class="mt-30">
									Just like the components of a rocket need to connect perfectly to ensure mission success, so must its data. We suspected that even though the data existed, users couldn't fully leverage it because of the fragmented experience of accessing it through multiple UIs. <span class="theme-1">I initiated and led a user research effort to understand this problem better. </span>
								</p>

								<h2 class="mt-60">The Question</h2>
                                <p>
                                    I set out to answer the following user research question:
                                </p>
								<p>
									<blockquote class="dark-bg">
									How do users interact with related data and how can their experience be improved?
								</blockquote>
								</p>


								<h2 class="mt-60"> Methods </h2>
								<h3 class="mt-30">Contextual Inquiry </h3>
								<p>
									A major challenge in this effort was the variety of users, data, and experiences it encompassed, all within a dense domain - rocket science to be exact. Rather than every designer getting a degree in aerospace engineering, the design team splits up the responsibility for understanding this domain. 
								</p>
								<p>
									I ran contextual inqueries with the users in my subdomain while they used our current search functionality. Overall, I spoke with 9 users.
								</p>
								<p>
									<!-- While most of the research up to this point might not have focused specifically on the questions laid out for this effort, we knew that these issues came up regualarly, even when users talked about other subjects.  -->
								</p>

								<blockquote class="dark-bg mt-30 quote">
									I want to be able to better choose what goes into export... Flexibility with simplicity. I donâ€™t want complexity. 
								</blockquote>
								<p class="caption">
                                     A contextual inquiry partipant describes the overly complex experience of building a search and customizing a csv export of that search.	
                                 </p>
								<p>
									Each of our 10 person design team collected further insights from users within their subdomains. But much like our users' data was siloed, so were our team's research findings. <!-- We intended to bring together insights  - the orphans in the affinity diagram, the casual user quote on left unaddressed -  from previous research projects across our wide base of evidence. Combined with previous research artifacts spread across our team,  -->I <span class="theme-1">consolidated the large set of disparate user research insights </span>across our design team and created generalized models from which we <span class="theme-1">extracted new findings and design ideas</span>. 
								</p>



								<h3 class="mt-60">Data Model</h3>
								<p>
									My question centered on users' interactions with data connections, e.g. a safety engineer's analysis of the temperature limitations of the rocket connects to a requirement for the weather conditions to keep it operational on launch day. So the first thing we did was model those connections. </p>

								<p>
									Our findings on 'hubs' and 'gaps' in the data eventually helped us determine what use cases to focus on in our designs.
								</p>

										</li>
									</ul>

								<h3 class="mt-60">Affinity</h3>
								<p>
									A major goal of this project was to extract common needs across our entire suite of data tools. We turned to an affinity diagram to help synthesize the low-level findings from research across several subdomains into high level findings that generalized to all of our users.
								</p>
								<a href="assets/images/user-research-space-exploration/affinity.jpg""><img src="assets/images/user-research-space-exploration/affinity.jpg"></a>
                                <p class="caption">

                                 </p>
								<p>
									Our findings from this project consisted largely of the various tasks that were common among our different users. These findings helped us to create a generalized workflow described in the next section.
								</p>

								<blockquote class="dark-bg">
									Main Findings:
									<ul>
										<li>
											<span class="theme-1">Gather</span> - users gather data from across multiple sources by searching and filtering our data on our sites
										</li>
										<li>
											<span class="theme-1">Organize</span> - linking and tagging functionality is used to make adhoc lists of various data types
										</li>
										<li>
											<span class="theme-1">Track</span> - users regularly check in on the status of the data that they care about
										</li>
										<li>
											<span class="theme-1">Analyze</span> - tracked data is used to create metrics to help analyze progress over time or find anomalies 
										</li>
										<li>
											<span class="theme-1">Report</span> - users report out their analyses at set mission milestones
										</li>
									</ul>
								</blockquote>

								<h3 class="mt-60">Workflow</h3>
								<p>
									<!-- We moved on to understanding how our users use the data.  --><!--How does it flow from one person to another? Or in some cases, get translated from one form to another, like from a data base to an excel export to a burndown chart? What do users do with the data? 
								</p>
								<p-->
									By consolidating previous research done across our team, we were able to abstract the unique workflows of individual user groups to a general understanding of how users interact with related data. 
								</p>
								 <a href="assets/images/user-research-space-exploration/integrated-workflow.svg""><img src="assets/images/user-research-space-exploration/integrated-workflow.svg"></a>
                                <p class="caption">
                                     The generalized workflow shows the tasks users complete using related data and how those tasks flow from one to the next.
                                 </p>

								<p>
									The workflow helped us identify the majority of the breakdowns in the process, telling us where to look for the second half of our research question: How can the user experience be improved?
								</p>

								<blockquote class="dark-bg">
									Main Workflow Breadowns:
									<ul>
										<li>
											There is no way to be directly notified of updates to data linked to yours. Users rely on word of mouth which can lead to <span class="theme-1">missing important information</span>.
										</li>
										<li>
											Our team has spent months of development time creating one time reports that stitch together data from across multiple sources. We are essentially delivering <span class="theme-1">extremely slow</span> search results.
										</li>
										<li>
											There is no real-time track lists of data across systems which leads to <span class="theme-1">out-of-date reporting</span>.
										</li>
									</ul>
								</blockquote>
                               


								<h3 class="mt-60">User Stories</h3>
								<p>
									Finally, we collected users stories from across the different user groups and consolidated them into epics that applied to our full user set. This step was crucial for connecting our research to our design phase. 
								</p>
								<p>
									These epics <span class="theme-1">captured why our users needed to do a certain task</span>, which gave us the freedom to design outside of existing tools, while grounding design decisions in research-backed evidence. Below is a sampling of the 8 user story epics derived from my research.
								</p>

								<blockquote class="dark-bg">
									<ul>
										<li>Epic 1
											<br /> As a stakeholder of a data item, I want to be <span class="theme-1">notified of status updates</span> to data linked to my item so that I can reassess risk.</li>
										<li>Epic 2
											<br /> As the data gatherer, I want to <span class="theme-1">search through cross-system data</span> in order to determine if it is important to track. </li>
										<li>Epic 3
											<br /> As the data gatherer, I want to <span class="theme-1">identify important items</span> so I can refer back to them at a later date.</li>
										<li>Epic 4
											<br /> As a data analyst, I want to <span class="theme-1">view data linked to mine</span> so I can complete my analysis.</li>

                                    Our first step in deciding the design direction was to focus in on the epics in which there were the biggest opportunities for improvement.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    We visualized the severity of breakdowns within an epic against the prevalence of that issue in the matrix below. We chose the 3 epics that were closest to the top right corner, since these were the most broudly applicable tasks in the most need of improvement. These are Epics 1 - 3 listed in the previous section.
